Cmdiary 0.1 [ joker__ ]
Here are few things to do. If you want to
contribute, please mail me at
<g.chers@gmail.com>.
Any suggestion, fix or bug segnalation
will be really appreciated.

Note: for the release of 1.0 version,
i want to satisfy at least the (1.0)
requests.

Fixes:
[ ] Support of any Windows platform. (1.0)
[ ] A nice installer, with setup.py
[ ] Sql request formulation in diary.get_notes
	was dramatic. It is still sqlinjectable.
	You may want to fix this to keep your data
	protected from the other computer users.
[ ] The program was not written with a
	"security in mind" approach. So it is NOT
	to be trusted agains attacks.

New functionalities:
[ ] I wish other languages will be supported.
	For languages handling, a class should be
	created: it will have a database of
	phrases in different languages.
[ ] Possibility to delete the user's note. (1.0)
[ ] Database has a field for the user's
	birthday. It would be nice if the program
	printed 'Happy birthday', on the user's
	birth day. (1.0)
[ ] Interfacing the calendar to other
	calendars (e.g. the google's one)
[ ] Recurrent events (as friends' birthdays,
	weekly appointments...)
